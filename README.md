# Ret2libc-Exploit-Write-up
Hello, this is a write-up for a form of a ret2libc ROP attack, which is used to bypass a exploit mitigation, known as NX for linux and DEP for windows.
I plan on making write-up's for ret2libc/ret2sys exploit attacks with and without ALSR or KALSR enabled in the near future.
